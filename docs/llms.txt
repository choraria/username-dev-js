# username.dev

> A simple API for username validation and moderation. Block profanity, protect brand names, identify premium handles, and prevent impersonation with one API call.

## What is username.dev?

username.dev provides a REST API that helps platforms validate and moderate usernames at registration time. Instead of building and maintaining your own profanity filters, brand protection lists, and reserved username databases, you can use our API to get instant results on whether a username should be allowed, flagged, or blocked.

The API checks usernames against:
- Profanity and inappropriate content
- Trademarked brand names
- Celebrity and public figure names
- System/admin-like terms
- Premium short usernames
- Unicode homoglyph attacks
- And 10+ other category types
